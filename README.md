## Inspiration

We were inspired by our own stories, times of hardship and loneliness in our personal lives. We wanted to create a place where people like us could relate to each other better and feel more encouraged to do wholesome activities.

## What it does

This program gives its users a chance to connect in groups, where they can chat and plan activities together. The software promotes community and encourages extroversion.

## How we built it

Our project focuses on versatility and portability. Each of the components of our tech stack were hand-picked for their wide feature set. We used Flutter, a cross-platform library that allows us to simultaneously deploy on Android, iOS, and the web. This was our first time integrating AI into the functionality of an app, and we were excited about it.

## Challenges we ran into

Despite most of us having used Flutter previously, we continually encountered issues that seemed to each be extremely rare, and had no known solution, including discovering a bug in one of the libraries we used. 3 of our laptops' development environments became unfixable, And it seemed that there was a unique bug targeting Linux just during this time. We also occasionally had some struggles with version control, which sometimes set us back a little bit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Some things that we were super proud to do was create our own instant messaging service within our app, along with creating events and an AI-driven feed that tailors its suggestions to the user! We also were extremely proud to achieve video calling functionality, which uses peer-to-peer encryption! We also created a robust real time messaging service with custom messages about upcoming events.

## What we learned

A technology that we learned a lot about these past 24 hours was WebRTC, which powered our video calling. In addition to that, we also learned a lot about being flexible in a fast-paced environment. Half of us had to switch to experimental web-based IDEs such as Project IDX. We also learned a lot about data management in Firebase, game mechanics, and AI integration!

## What's next for Campfire

Campfire has its sights set high - Our original app was mostly targeted towards men, but it's in our plans to make a more female-oriented one as well!
